# Table Entity Definitions

The core concept of the tables extension is the **Table Definition**. A table definition describes the structure of a table, including its data source, columns, and formatting options.

In the [Usage](../usage.md) section, we demonstrated how to create a simple table definition by subclassing `TableDefinition` and defining columns using `ColumnDefinition`.
